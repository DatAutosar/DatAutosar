# PyThon_Tkinter_Interface-
This project involves building an interface using Python's Tkinter library. The application will receive physical data and convert CAN (Controller Area Network) data from an Arduino Uno through a Serial Port. The Arduino program is designed to handle data specifically for the Mazda CX-5 vehicle. This project was developed by a Group of students from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education.
